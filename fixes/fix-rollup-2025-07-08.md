# GAM Scripts Fix Rollup - July 8, 2025
## Comprehensive Code Review and Fixes Applied

### Overview
This document serves as a historical reference for the comprehensive code review and fixes applied to the GAM administration scripts on July 8, 2025. This was a one-time major overhaul to update all scripts for GAM 7.11 compatibility and implement shared configuration management. All critical issues have been resolved.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Critical Logic Errors Fixed ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

**Multi-Script.sh fixes:**
- Line 5: Fixed macOS-specific date command `date -v+90d` → `date -d '+90 days'` for Linux compatibility
- Line 24: Fixed unquoted variable `[[ -z $email ]]` → `[[ -z "$email" ]]`
- Line 232: Fixed typo `groupCENTSTUDest4` → `groupCENTSTUDnest4`
- Line 238: Fixed typo `group7STUDtatic` → `groupMSSTUD7static`
- Line 239: Fixed variable name `group7STUDstatic` → `groupMSSTUD7static`
- Line 240: Fixed variable name `group8STUDstatic` → `groupMSSTUD8static`

**PrintGroupMembers.sh fixes:**
- Line 7: Fixed proper variable quoting `[ -n $GroupEmail ]` → `[ -n "$GroupEmail" ]`

**Disable-User.sh fixes:**
- Line 8: Fixed unquoted variable `[ -n $UserEmail ]` → `[ -n "$UserEmail" ]`

### 2. GAM Binary Path Updates ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

Updated GAM binary path in all scripts from `/home/isaac/bin/gamadv-xtd3/gam` to `/home/isaac/bin/gamadv-xtd3/gam7/gam`:

- ✅ Multi-Script.sh (already updated)
- ✅ GROUPS/groups-script.sh
- ✅ Disable-User.sh
- ✅ PrintGroupMembers.sh
- ✅ Student-OU-Sync.sh
- ✅ Suspend Users in Bulk/Account Action - Suspend Students in Bulk.sh

### 3. Platform Compatibility Issues ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

- ✅ Fixed macOS-specific date command in Multi-Script.sh
- ✅ Fixed non-existent `pause` command in bulk suspend script → `read -p "Press any key to continue..." -n 1 -r`
- ✅ Changed shell shebang in Student-OU-Sync.sh from `#!/bin/sh` to `#!/bin/bash` for consistency

### 4. Path Consistency Issues ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

**Bulk suspend script fixes:**
- Added proper variable usage: `gam csv` → `$gam csv` (3 instances)
- Fixed non-existent `pause` command

### 5. Shell Best Practices ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

- ✅ Fixed unquoted variables across all scripts
- ✅ Standardized shell shebangs to `#!/bin/bash`
- ✅ Fixed command syntax errors
- ✅ Improved variable naming consistency

### 6. New Shared Configuration File ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

Created `shared-config.sh` with:
- Centralized GAM binary path configuration
- Domain and OU path constants
- Logging functionality with `log_action()` and `run_gam_safe()` functions
- Email validation function
- Automatic log directory creation

## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **Multi-Script.sh** - 6 fixes applied
2. **GROUPS/groups-script.sh** - GAM path update
3. **Disable-User.sh** - GAM path update + variable quoting fix
4. **PrintGroupMembers.sh** - GAM path update + variable quoting fix
5. **Student-OU-Sync.sh** - GAM path update + shell shebang fix
6. **Suspend Users in Bulk/Account Action - Suspend Students in Bulk.sh** - GAM path update + OU path fix + command syntax fixes

### Files Created:
1. **shared-config.sh** - New shared configuration file with utility functions
2. **fixes/fix-rollup.md** - This documentation file

### 7. Shared Configuration Integration ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

All scripts have been updated to use the shared configuration file:

- ✅ **Multi-Script.sh** - Now sources shared-config.sh and uses $GAM_PATH, $DOMAIN, $SUSPENDED_STUDENTS_OU, $SUSPENDED_STAFF_OU
- ✅ **GROUPS/groups-script.sh** - Updated to use $GAM_PATH from shared config
- ✅ **Disable-User.sh** - Now uses shared config with proper OU path variables
- ✅ **PrintGroupMembers.sh** - Updated to use $GAM_PATH from shared config  
- ✅ **Student-OU-Sync.sh** - Updated to use $GAM_PATH from shared config
- ✅ **Suspend Users in Bulk/Account Action - Suspend Students in Bulk.sh** - Updated to use shared config with $SUSPENDED_STUDENTS_OU

**Benefits of Shared Configuration:**
- Centralized GAM binary path management
- Consistent OU path definitions across all scripts
- Built-in logging functions (`log_action()`, `run_gam_safe()`)
- Email validation function available to all scripts
- Easier maintenance and updates

**Implementation Details:**
- All scripts now source `shared-config.sh` using `source "$(dirname "$0")/shared-config.sh"`
- Replaced hardcoded GAM paths with `$GAM_PATH` variable
- Updated all GAM commands to use proper variable quoting (e.g., `"$GAM_PATH" user "$email"`)
- Replaced hardcoded OU paths with centralized variables (`$SUSPENDED_STUDENTS_OU`, `$SUSPENDED_STAFF_OU`)
- Updated domain references to use `$DOMAIN` variable

**Error Resolution:**
- Multi-Script.sh had 3 instances of `$gam update user $email suspended on` that needed individual context-specific updates
- Each instance was updated separately to use `"$GAM_PATH" update user "$email" suspended on`
- All suspend commands across all scripts now use consistent variable quoting and shared configuration

## Next Steps (Optional)

For future improvements, consider:
1. Adding error handling with `set -euo pipefail` to all scripts
2. Implementing comprehensive logging using the new utility functions
3. Adding input validation using the new `validate_email()` function
4. Using the `run_gam_safe()` function for better error handling
